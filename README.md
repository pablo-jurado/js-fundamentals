I am a front end engineering student at the Iron Yard. This are exercises to practice loops iteration

#### PART 1
Write a function maxOfArray() that takes an array of numbers as an argument and finds the highest number.

----

#### PART 2
Write a function isVowel() that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1)
and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

----

#### Part 3
Define a function reverse() that computes
the reversal of a string. For example,
reverse("skoob") should return the
string "books".

----

#### Part 4
write a function the returns a FizzBuzz string for some number N (counting up from 1).
- for every number that isn't a multiple of 3 or 5, return a period "."
- for every number that is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), return "fizz"
- for every number that is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), return "buzz"
- for every number that is a multiple of 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz"

----

#### Part 5
Write a function findLongestWord() that takes a string of words and returns the longest word.
i.e. findLongestWord("a book full of dogs") should return "book"

----

#### PART 6
write a function that returns the Greatest Common Denominator of two numbers
- if no GCD exists, return 1

----

#### PART 7
Write a function called squareDance() that squares each number in an array.

----

#### PART 8
Write a function called nicer(). It should clean up the language in its input sentence.

----

#### PART 9
Write a function called properSentences(). It should take as input a string
and capitalize the first letter of every sentence in that string.
(For our purposes, all sentences will end with periods. Write one that works
with ? and ! and receive a gratifying high five, right on the hand!)

----

#### PART 10
Write a function called iPutTheFunIn(). It should take a string as input.
The output should be a copy of the original string with the word 'fun' inserted into the center of the string.

----

#### PART 11
Write a function called pipeline(). it should take three inputs: (1) a starting value,
(2) a function, and (3) another function. it should use functions (2) and (3) on the
starting value, one after the other, and return a new value that has been processed
by both function (2) and function (3).
